# Crypto_Clusters

In this Jupyter notebook I utilize financial Python programming and unsupervised machine learning skills to cluster cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods, then plot the results to visually show performance.

## Skills utilized:

-- Import the cryptocurrency dataset with periodic performance metrics.

-- Identify which periodic performance metrics relate the most to clustering.

-- Find a reasonable cluster size.

-- Cluster the data by using the K-means algorithm on the most important performance metrics.

-- Graph and interpret the results.

## The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

-- Import the Data 

-- Prepare the Data 

-- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data

-- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data

-- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

-- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

-- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

-- Visualize and Compare the Results
