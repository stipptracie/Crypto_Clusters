# Crypto_Clusters

## Skills utilized:

-- Import the cryptocurrency dataset with periodic performance metrics.

-- Identify which periodic performance metrics relate the most to clustering.

-- Find a reasonable cluster size.

-- Cluster the data by using the K-means algorithm on the most important performance metrics.

-- Graph and interpret the results.

## The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

-- Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
-- Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
-- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
-- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
-- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
-- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
-- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
-- Visualize and Compare the Results
